            Inside Out is a 2015 American computer-animated film written and directed by Pete Docter, 
        with a screenplay by Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley, based on a story by Ronnie del Carmen. 
        It stars the voices of Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Richard Kind, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, 
        Mindy Kaling, Kaitlyn Dias, Diane Lane, and Kyle MacLachlan. The film follows five personified 
        emotions: Joy (Poehler), Sadness (Smith), Fear (Hader), Anger (Black), and Disgust (Kaling). 
        Inside the mind, they lead a young girl named Riley (Dias) through life as she and her parents 
        (Lane and MacLachlan) adjust to their new surroundings after moving from Minnesota to San Francisco.
<br>
            Docter conceived Inside Out in late 2009 after noticing changes in his daughter's personality as 
        she grew older, and it was subsequently green-lit. Based on Docter and del Carmen's remembrances, 
        the emotions were repurposed for use in the film. During production, the filmmakers consulted 
        psychologists and neuroscientists in order to achieve greater accuracy in their portrayal of the 
        mind. Development on Inside Out lasted for five and a half years, on an approximate $175 million 
        budget, and the film faced production difficulties, including story changes.

    <p>
            Within the mind of a young girl named Riley are the basic emotions that control her actions: Joy, 
            Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. Her experiences become memories, stored as colored orbs, which 
            are sent into long-term memory each night. The aspects of five most important "core memories" within 
            her personality incorporate the form of floating islands. Joy acts as the leader, and she and the 
            rest of the emotions try to limit Sadness's influence. At the age of 11, Riley moves from Minnesota 
            to San Francisco for her father's new job. She at first has poor experiences; the new house is cramped 
            and old, her father hardly has any time for her, a local pizza parlor only serves pizza topped with 
            broccoli (which Riley dislikes), and the moving van with their belongings ends up in Texas and will 
            not arrive for weeks. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness retroactively turns joyous 
            memories sad, which causes Riley to cry in front of her class and creates a sad core memory. Joy 
            tries to dispose of it by using a vacuum tube but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose 
            during a struggle with Sadness, disabling the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories 
            are sucked out of Headquarters. In Joy and Sadness's absence, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are forced to 
            take control of Riley with disastrous results, distancing Riley from her parents, friends, and hobbies.
